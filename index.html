      <p class="brief-history">The Mother of God Church (Mae de Deus Church) in Pomburpa is a historic Catholic parish church in North Goa. Founded in 1590, it is known for its Mannerist Neo-Roman style and picturesque riverside location. 
<br>
The church was founded by Franciscan Tertiaries Luisa da Madre de Deus and Ana de Santa Maria - a daughter and a mother.
It was donated to the Franciscans on 11th June 1604 and was later rebuilt or remodeled in the 18th century.
It features a distinctive "Franciscan" facade with a single nave, a tile roof, and flanking towers.
Inside, the Goan Rococo design includes elaborate stucco work and a main reredos (altarpiece) influenced by the St. Cajetan church in Old Goa. 
<br>
The annual church feast is celebrated on February 2nd, the Feast of the Purification of Our Lady (also known as Our Lady of Candelaria).
This festival has historically been associated with the blessing of candles.
The feast was historically known for a popular saying, "The Pomburpa festivals are not for the poor," due to the lavish displays of wealth by landowners and gentry.
