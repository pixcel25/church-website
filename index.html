      <p class="brief-history">Pomburpa Church, officially known as **Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church**, is a historic Catholic church located in Pomburpa, Goa. Built in the early 17th century, it is one of the oldest parish churches in the state. The church is renowned for its beautiful white façade, classic Goan-Portuguese architecture, and scenic location overlooking lush greenery. It is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, reflecting strong Marian devotion. The annual parish feast held in December draws many devotees and visitors. Serving as a spiritual and cultural landmark, Pomburpa Church continues to preserve Goa’s Christian heritage.
